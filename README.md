# open-graph-next

Luis's personal experiments in post-LLM open, human-centric, human-curated knowledge.

## Motivation

LLMs are going to reshape how open knowledge is created, maintained, and connected. For open software projects, [adapting will be time-consuming but doable](https://bsky.app/profile/lu.is/post/3meyjdbdox22j). For Wikipedia and the broader open knowledge graph, it's going to be a lot harder — and that's the real challenge for the human web.

This repo is a working space for exploring what that adaptation might look like: how LLMs can help make open knowledge more rigorous, more exhaustive, and more interconnected — without losing the human collaboration that makes it irreplaceable and a monument to the human spirit.

## Sub-projects

- **all-the-opens/** — Rabbit Hole Browser: a D3.js force-directed graph prototype exploring what cooperative knowledge infrastructure could feel like, connecting resources across Internet Archive, Wikipedia, Wikimedia Commons, OpenLibrary, Smithsonian, and more.
- **wikidata-SIFT/** — *(pending merge)* LLM-assisted Wikidata methodology testing and enrichment: using LLMs to systematically find and verify missing claims in Wikidata.
