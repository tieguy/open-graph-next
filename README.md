# All The Opens

Exploring what it would look like if open knowledge institutions worked together at internet speed.

Two prototypes:

- **web-demo/** - A D3.js force-directed graph connecting Apollo 11 resources across Internet Archive, Wikipedia, Wikimedia Commons, OpenLibrary, Smithsonian, and more
- **extension/** - A Chrome extension that surfaces related open knowledge resources while browsing Wikipedia

## Inspiration

This project is inspired by conversations with [Jennie Rose Halperin](https://jennierosehalperin.me) about cooperative knowledge infrastructure and the future of libraries.
