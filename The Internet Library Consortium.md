# The Internet Library Consortium: A New Framework for Library Futures

## How can digital knowledge organizations make the Internet work more like a library?

## Summary

Building power for the future means drawing on and rethinking existing models through cooperative organization. This document (a “planifesto”) outlines what a digital-first consortium that operates for the internet at internet speed could look like, and how it could shape the way that libraries, digital collections, and vendors interact in the future. Much like other consortia were built to address computerization in the 1960s and 1970s, a new consortial model by and for the internet could rethink our definition of what libraries are and what they could be in order to make the internet work more like a library, generally, and a library address the myriad challenges and opportunities of the digital age.  
The Internet Library Consortium is a reframing of how Library Futures works with existing institutions and organizations through a cooperative approach to technology, content negotiation, professional development, and shared copies. Rather than an archipelago of individual sites and institutions hosting content, a joint consortium can better serve users of all types to solve real problems for internet users and shape a better web.

## The problem

Everyone should have access to a great library, and in some ways, mass digitization should have already made that possible. Enormous digital collections, from the Internet Archive to Wikipedia to the Metropolitan Museum of Art are scattered across the web, some open and some locked away, with a variety of rights, technical infrastructure, institutional remits, norms, and power structures (to name a few issues) governing each. 

Organizations of all types and sizes are building open infrastructure and breaking down enclosures. As an open movement, we recognize the primacy of digital public goods, but we still exist largely in siloed projects and communities, and without any overarching organizing principle that will actually put these collections in the hands of users by utilizing the services they already rely on – or even building something totally different.

Library technology infrastructure and distribution channels, from Proquest to Elsevier to Overdrive, is controlled by a few corporations driven by data analytics and leveraged by investment and capital, and solving the problems of digital infrastructure is going to take a cooperative effort. In the open knowledge space, hundreds of institutions have released their materials through open licenses, but cooperation, coordination, and broad-scale, service-based solutions to technical and community problems remain vexing and out of reach. 

Why is this? How could a cooperative approach get these collections into the hands of more users?

## The goal

We have to build real solutions for our users and address the age of mass digitization and platformization head on. This means utilizing best practices and leveraging community power in order to better leverage digitized collections so they don’t languish on siloed websites or become increasingly unfindable due to the ephemerality of the web.

As we continue to grapple with the hegemonic power of corporate owned systems – like AWS, big publishing, and social media platforms – knowledge institutions and organizations will have to chart a cooperative path forward into a new digital future. These kinds of systems are weaker, less effective, and more brittle. The centralization of infrastructure, with corporate business platforms and big publishing dictating the future of libraries and their collections, is a disservice to us all. We’ve built robust digital collections, we’ve created communities of practice, and we’ve even built technical infrastructure to take care of these resources. It’s time we put it to good use through a more cooperative, sharing approach.

Library digital collections and digitized cultural heritage are at risk due to the current techno-social landscape, but we also need better digital infrastructure for handling in-copyright works together. The problems we seek to remedy are social and legal, but they are also technological – new technologies will provide possibilities for preservation of and unfettered access to information access and retrieval, better content sharing will provide more opportunities for knowledge organizations of all types to harness their power, and professional development and policy will serve as the base from which we center our work. Decentralized networks, community technology, exit to community, a more coordinated approach to open source, and a shared approach to problem solving can shift the power dynamic from the vendor to the organization or institution.

Librarians abide by a set of professional ethics that includes an emphasis on privacy, user rights, permanent preservation of knowledge, and a balanced intellectual property regime (see [https://www.ala.org/tools/ethics](https://www.ala.org/tools/ethics)). These values are critical to the profession, and can help guide technology toward a more equitable future, but we have to do it together.

## Enter the consortium

A consortium is a **cooperative association of organizations** that **coordinates resources** on behalf of their members, including **content negotiation, shared technology infrastructure, professional development, and shared copies.**

What would a consortium of digital knowledge institutions resemble? How can we build power through a community approach and solve real problems together? How can we better advocate for knowledge institutions in a digital world by meeting people where they are?

In a consortium, each individual institution is ultimately responsible for their own collections and infrastructure, but power is built in shared responsibility, problem solving, accountability, and funding. Consortia can negotiate with publishers, create shared technology that benefits everyone, author professional development, and ensure that copies of digital infrastructure are not lost.

While open collections are the lower hanging fruit in this scenario, the hope would be that a consortium of this type would address licensed or rights-based content as well, making it more possible for digital-first organizations or other consortia to leverage their existing power and build more together.

An example of a successful (though admittedly entrenched) consortial model is OCLC. Formed for the purposes of shared cataloging, OCLC saw the benefits of a cooperative approach to records management that has become ubiquitous across the knowledge economy. Regional consortia successfully negotiate better licensing and contracts for their member institutions, provide professional development, shape policy, and create shared technical infrastructure. Bringing together knowledge organizations and institutions around shared goals and problems is a tried-and-true method, and led by Library Futures, this consortium could build a library movement for the future. 

A consortial model would not be built in order to supersede the negotiations, professional development, or technical projects of its members, but rather shape a cooperative approach and build power through a shared membership model that enhances the way we do our work. As technology changes and digital content becomes more ubiquitous, there is no need for digital libraries to move like frigates. We can coordinate to build the world we want to see.

Creating an internet library consortium is a step toward ensuring the longevity and interoperability of digital resources, of bringing together organizations with shared goals to build another model, particularly one that will work for the next generation of the web, and of the future.

## Rethinking the definition of “library”... moving toward knowledge organizations

When people think about “libraries,” they usually think of the brick and mortar building they visited as a child, or of the vendor solutions that provide them their digital materials, like Overdrive. In some cases, they don’t think of anything at all.

Digital libraries and archives come in all shapes and sizes, from the Internet Archive to Wikimedia Commons to the Biodiversity Heritage Library, and breaking down traditional definitions in order to build a big tent movement to address equitable knowledge production and distribution globally, we need to destabilize the “library” as we know it. Rethinking this definition will also support better internet policy to achieve equitable knowledge for everyone.

The Internet Library Consortium might not be the right framing, and that’s okay\! The goal is to rethink our definition of what libraries are and what they could be in order to make the internet work more like a library, generally, and a library that can address the myriad challenges and opportunities of the internet.

## What would membership look like? How would this be funded?

## Who would join the consortium?

Library Futures is focused primarily on the issues of *collections and access*, so the framing for this group would be organizations and institutions that hold collections of digital materials, particularly cultural heritage material. It would also include organizations that shape or steward those collections, like rights organizations and consortia.  
This includes:

* Individual libraries and archives  
* Public libraries that have either digitized or want to digitize collections of local or global significance  
* Wikimedia Commons \+ Wikimedia Library  
* Internet Archive  
* Creative Commons  
* Google Scholar  
* Other library consortia  
* DPLA  
* Flickr Commons  
* \+ more….

## (Starter) unresolved questions and potential roadblocks:

* What about other consortia? Could they join in this model? How would a consortium of consortia actually operate?  
* Is this only about organizations with significant digital content? What about all the other organizations working for better shared knowledge infrastructure in our space?  
* How could you run this project without scope creeping to solve problems effectively? (Small scale experiments?)  
* How are we not replicating the work of the many, many consortia that already exist?  
* How does this not become Europeana or the original DPLA? How are we safeguarding our systems so we don’t repeat the exact same successes or failures of the past?
