## Structure

- `all-the-opens/` - Rabbit Hole Browser: D3.js prototype exploring cooperative knowledge infrastructure across open sources
- `wikidata-SIFT/` - LLM-assisted Wikidata methodology testing and enrichment (merged from wikidata-llm-experiment)

Each subdirectory has its own CLAUDE.md with project-specific details.
