    provenance: verified
    source_type: primary
    supports_claim: true
    summary: >
      Official university staff page lists Rieznik as lecturer in the
      Department of Soil Science, Faculty of Agronomy and Plant Protection.

    provenance: reported
    source_type: secondary
    supports_claim: unknown
    summary: >
      Academic publication confirms Rieznik as a soil scientist based in
      Kharkiv, previously affiliated with Kharkiv National Agrarian University.
      Consistent with the career timeline on the university staff page showing
      he moved to DBTU, but does not directly confirm current employment.

verdict: verified-high
rationale: >
  The primary source (official university staff page) directly confirms
  Rieznik's employment at State Biotechnological University as a lecturer
  in soil science. The reference URL cited in the edit is this same staff
  page and is accessible. Independent academic publications corroborate
  his identity as a soil scientist in the Kharkiv region. The start time
  qualifier of 2023 is consistent with the career timeline on the staff page.

trace_triggered: false

improvements:
  - "P580 (start time) qualifier shows 2023 which matches the staff page -- already present, no change needed"
  - "Consider adding P512 (academic degree) = PhD, with start time 2023, citing the same staff page"
  - "Consider adding P101 (field of work) = soil science (Q207700)"
