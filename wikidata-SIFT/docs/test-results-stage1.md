# Stage 1 Test Results

**Test Period:** [Start Date] - [End Date]
**Tested By:** [Name(s)]

## Summary

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total entities tested | /60 |
| Total claims proposed | |
| Total claims verified | |
| SIFT accuracy | % |
| Value accuracy | % |
| Average verification time per claim | min |

## Go/No-Go Assessment

**SIFT Accuracy:** [X]%

- [ ] ≥99% - Autonomous operation viable
- [ ] 95-99% - Consider confidence-based filtering
- [ ] <95% - Methodology needs iteration

**Recommendation:** [PROCEED / ITERATE / STOP]

## Next Steps

Based on results:
- [ ] If ≥99%: Proceed to Stage 2 (confidence calibration)
- [ ] If 95-99%: Analyze high-confidence subset
- [ ] If <95%: Document failure patterns, iterate methodology
